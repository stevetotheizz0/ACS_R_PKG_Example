#Examples of Gathering Data from the ACS using R's ACS Package

This script coincides with a blog post that I published on March 23rd on my [website](http://stephenskilton.com/blog).

Included is an R script that will gather 3 different tables of data related to rental units for select census tracts. I've also included a file to use as the input for a few tracts as well to run with it. Just be sure to install all the necessary R packages, and change the workspace to correspond with your own file path.
